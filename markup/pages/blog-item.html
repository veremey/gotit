				<h2>
					A Solid Brand Building Process
				</h2>
				<p>
					Storyboards on Demand provides a marketplace for artists and branding agencies to buy concept art, on demand as well as custom designs, for pitches and projects. This unique service competes with major players in the creative scene, so the design and content had to clearly convey what makes them different (and better). Their target audience is creative directors, art directors, and other agency creatives – so the graphics had to impress.
				</p>
				<p>
					We set out to introduce their new concept in illustration through a web presence with interesting visuals, an intuitive user experience, effective SEO, and engaging email marketing campaigns. We sharpened creative direction throughout industry research and lively client conversations.
				</p>
				<p>
					The technical side of this E-Commerce site called for expertise in HTML5, CSS3, and Jquery. Along the way we added advanced WordPress features, such as coupon code capability and abandoned cart tracking to generate recovery emails. We dedicated a lot of thinking to the management of users’ uploads - it was crucial that we got this part right.
